/*
Given an integer array of size n, write a program to find all the Leaders in the array. An element is a Leader if it is
strictly greater than all the elements to its right side. The last element of an array is a Leader by default.
The largest element of an array is also a Leader by default. Suppose all the array elements are unique.
Ordering in the output doesnâ€™t matter.

Important note: before moving on to the solutions,
we recommend trying this problem on paper for at least 15 or 30 minutes.

Example 1: Input: [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2] Output: [17, 5, 2]
